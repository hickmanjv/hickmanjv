                <p><br/><img id="crops" class="pageImages" src="Images/index.jpg" alt="field of crops">I was born in Sikeston, MO and spent all of my adolescence in Southeast Missouri. I come from a blended family where I have an older stepbrother and a younger half sister. My brother and I got into our fair share of trouble together to my mother's dismay. My family moved frequently growing up and I eventually graduated high school from Bell City, MO. Bell City is an extremely small town made up of mostly farmers and people who commute long distances for working opportunites. After high school I moved to Columbia, MO and started working at the University Hospital. I am currently working full time and the hospital and attending Mizzou full time in pursuit of my degree in Computer Science. I have a very strong inclination that I will be also obtaining my Masters in CS.<br><br>

This allows me to befriend practically anyone. I enjoy everything from any sport, movies, gaming, music, art, fishing, camping, to anime (some are too over-the-top to be honest), dungeons and dragons and other tabletop games. Scotch and beer are also good friends of mine. I do find that I do not care for the extremes of anything thing however. An example would be when hard rock turns in to screamo metal. At that point it's just too much. Ninety-nine percent of the time if I'm with a group of people and they want to go do/watch something, I'll find it interesting and entertaining. I very much enjoy the life experience. In my spare time I enjoy unwinding with a movie or a game, learning to ride my motorcycle I recently purchased, or hanging out with friends over good food and good drinks.<br>
