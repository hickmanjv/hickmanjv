This is the repository for all of my coursework thus far. It is constantly being updated  
and will have new files each week/per assignment  

I have unfortunately lost my C++ work for good.  

Working 40hrs a week and taking a full time class load doesn't lend itself to having much free time  
for other projects, however, they will be added once any are started/completed

One of my projects will be staying private and I am currently working on a couple of patents  
related to it and some other ideas
