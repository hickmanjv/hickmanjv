    print("""\n\tI am a non-traditional undergraduate student at the University of Missouri. The
        original plan was to purse biomedical engineering from high school, however life happens
        and I ended up moving to Columbia in August \'05 for Mizzou and started working at the
        University Hospital to get some experience with medical devices for that field. The problem
        field. This caused me to find a love of medicine and plans changed to then purse medical
        was that they were all just that, plans. I did not get myself enrolled back into university.
        The more years I spent at the hospital, I just became more comfortable with my day to day
        life. By the time I started back, I was in my 30\'s and I felt that I had to re-evaluate
        some things. That caused me to take a programming course and I absolutely loved it. Ever
        since then I have been a CS major and have truly enjoyed every minute at Mizzou.""")
