## Goals of the Application
The purpose of the application is to create an all encompassing group of web apps for a person that is wanting to 
create and sell their own products from their own site, instead of other popular options. They will have a way to 
read a personal blog of the seller and see the app that sells the items they have created. 

It's core audience would be those that would visit the website 'Etsy'. In this case the person, if they wanted would
be able to create their own site and not rely on sites like 'Etsy'. The blog would be a way to keep their customers
updated on what is coming and feedback.

I will not be collecting data, but displaying it for the users.
