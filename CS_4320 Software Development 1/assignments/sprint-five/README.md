## Sprint 5

When looking through the assignments, I kind of thought they were their own each individual assignment, however after going through each, and noticing the a, b, c, etc. it seems as though I did most of my initial work on 13a. 

I chose to use Auth0 SSO, and for my initial project was to get it actually working. So I used the template provided
by Auth0 for the login and an using the Django I have connected another app to it on the back end allowing for SSO that
will log you in for both of those apps.

All of the instructions for the SSO-project are in the Sprint-4/SSO-Project/README.md file
