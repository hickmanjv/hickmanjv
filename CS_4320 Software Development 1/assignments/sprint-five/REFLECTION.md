## Reflections on SSO attempts
In my Sprint-4 there is a very long reflections document describing what I attempted to get working and what
I found extremely confusing. 

After going through your examples, I can say that even though I was frustrated for quite a while trying to figure
everything out through documentations and tutorials, I am ultimately glad that I did. I feel that if I was to look
through your examples from dex or the flask application, then I would have tried to patch something together from
those examples and probably not have understood as much as I currently do because of time constraints that I have
will my daily life and finals.

I really like Django, so I wanted to try and find a solution for that framework and after a lot of searching, I did
find a great solution. My initial 'google fu' failed me because the Auth0 seems very well established and robust. I
honestly don't know how I missed it after going through Sails.js and Ory Hydra. Speaking of Ory Hydra, I definitely didn't have enough time to spend on reading through everything in the documenation, but man that one seemed really complicated. Since the concept isn't that techincal I'm assuming, I was just missing something and not getting what
they were trying to convey to potential users. 

I really enjoy learning new things, purgatory to me is doing a job where nothing changes day after day. So becoming
familiar with new languages, frameworks, or tools (venv, homebrew) is something that I really enjoy doing. The comment
about cognitive stress and emotional stress hit home. I've been losing my stuff lately. I appreciate the direction and
patience you've offered on this course.

### What I hope to have accomplished
To be perfectly honest, if I get the authentication server working and 2 different apps connecting to it and logging
the user into both of them, I would consider that a massive victory for me. As of writing this, I do have that 
accomplished and now that finals are over and I got this to work, my headaches have stopped. I feel ok for the first 
time in quite a few weeks/months. 

Ideally, I would have the blog working (from an example I had previously worked through on my own time). And changed
the demo storefront to be more interactive to match the them of the blog.
