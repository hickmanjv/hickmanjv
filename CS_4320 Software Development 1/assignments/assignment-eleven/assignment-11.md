### Working Group  

I am planning to join the value working group meeting, there seems to be a lot of open spaces for metrics and value is a very big piece of the OSS puzzle.  

### Podcast  

After listening to the podcast it was nice hearing a concise answer to what is CHAOSS and what are it's goals. It really tied everything together for me. I would have loved to listen to that at the beginning of the semester. The bit about community health at the conference made me chuckle: (eh, whatever, let's just do it). Hearing how they all joined and started working on something that for me seems massive and more than a little daunting helped put things into a perspective of this is actually something worthwhile and not out of my current skillset.
