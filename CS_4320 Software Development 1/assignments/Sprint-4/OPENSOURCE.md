##Why participate in Open Source Software?
I remember when I was younger, a friend's dad downloaded a very early verision of Debian Linux which was probably
around mid 1997. We messed around on message boards trying to find the correct software to mount his computers 
various drives. His dad was geeking out about Linux and how it was going to finally topple Microsoft because people from all over the world are working to make it better every single day. It didn't sink in at the time just how new and exciting that era was for OSS as I was in middle school. Back then, it seemed as though people were doing that as a hobby to me, something they enjoyed doing. 

OSS today is an altogether different beast. From altruism, hobbies, corporate involvement, and massive frameworks
that drive new technologies, OSS has become an integral force in the world. As someone that has a full time job and
pursing my CS degree, the thought of participating as a 'hobby' baffles me because my free time is almost non-existent.
However, there are muliple different avenues for people of all different sorts of motivations to find a reason to 
participate. 

The first article talked about the different motivators behind why someone would participate in OSS. It covered the gamut
of why someone get involved in the OSS community. I was suprised by the answers to the poll in the article though. I
know it was a very small sample size, but the biggest motivators were fun, learning, and altruism. This to me was
where I thought OSS started, but would have moved on from as more and more money can be made from being involved
in OSS. I am really happy that a lot of that sentiment is still prevalent in OSS because it feels 'pure' for whatever
reason. 

The article from the Linux Foundation had a lot more substance, particularly from the corporate side. It covered why a company should contribute to OSS, listing the benefits to the organization. Then the article when into how exactly to 
achieve this. To me this article is basically a blueprint on how to get your organization involved with OSS the right way as to make it as seamless and beneficial as possible. As someone who will be looking for employment, it isn't hard to see how participating in the OSS community can definitely increase future job prospects by the way they explain the 
do's and don'ts of getting involved in projects. 

Breaking down the governance of a project was extremely important. From this semester, when jumping in to different
projects, it is so easy to feel lost. But this article approached corporate involvement from that perspective. An employee or manager wanting to leverage the benefits of OSS but not knowing how to go about doing it properly. Having the leadership structure outlined and explained in this way has left me feeling confident that I could find a project,
spend some time and learn the proper ways to help and contribute. 

I enjoyed how the article explained to potential companies the wrong way to go about inserting themselves into projects. I am probably super cynical, but that to me is the most baffling part of OSS. How major players in the software industry haven't been able to exert their influence and cash over anything and everything they want in OSS development.
