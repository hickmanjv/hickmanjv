## Which Open Source Licences I prefer
This is a rabbit hole, I didn't expect. Not only are there a ton of them, there are also different
versions of the base license, such as AGPL and LGPL, and Google won't even work with anything that
has the AGPL licence. Some play nice with others and some don't. It was eye opening because as I 
have been getting started with GitHub and OSS, I have been focused on the software itself and the 
wall of documentation. Licensing took a backseat for me but is a very important starting point.

### MIT
This one is really easy to like because it's so darn short. It is very plain and clear to read and 
takes about 10 seconds to get through because it gets to the point and does is clearly. I like that
it offers liability disclaimers to protect the creator of the software, and the fact that you can
do anything you want with the piece of the software you want. If you want to use it in your own 
project and sell it off to people, you are free to do so, but those people can do whatever they want
with your software also. 


### GPLv3
This license is a lot more complex. However, certain parts did catch my attention. Specifically the
part that prevents 'Tivoization'. I'm quite a bit older than most of my peers in your class, born in 
1984, so I grew up with the concept of if you buy it...then it's yours to own. Paying for a limited 
license that they can take away from you or say that you can't manipulate on your own feels completely
absurd to me, but as the younger generations come about, it will feel normal to them. I like that this
license makes it so those rights can't be taken away. 

Also the part of protection from patent hungry companies. The example I read was of the Novell-Microsoft
deal. I'm all for being able to make money, lots of it, and to be incredibly successful, but a lot of 
corporations go way to far for me. This license tries to offer some protections for that type of
predatory behavior.

If I were to try and create OSS that I think could take off, I might look very strong at GPLv3
